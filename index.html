<h1>Happy Valentine’s Day, Gilbert! ❤️</h1>
<p>Hii babyyy!😍</p>
<p>I don’t even know where to begin because words never feel big enough when it comes to you. You are more than just my boyfriend... you are my safe place, my best friend, my baby, my princess and lot's moreee!🤭</p>
<p>Thank you for loving me gently, patiently, and intentionally. Thank you for all your reassurance, the way you make me feel special and feel valued.</p>
<p>I love how you care, how you make me feel beautiful, appreciated, and deeply loved in ways I didn’t even know I needed.</p>
<p>Being with you has taught me that love isn’t just about sweet words but it’s about peace, consistency, friendship, and choosing each other every single day. And I choose you, my babyyy!💕</p>
<p>You are such a blessing in my life, and I thank God for you. I pray that our love continues to grow stronger, deeper, and sweeter with time.</p>
<p>Happy Valentine’s Day my babyyy! I love you so muchhh! 🫶🏾</p>
